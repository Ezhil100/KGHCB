## 💡 Future SMS Options

If you decide you want SMS notifications later, you have these better alternatives:

| Provider     | Best For         | Cost (India)   | Verification |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **MSG91**    | India, no hassle | ₹0.15-0.25/SMS | ❌ No        |
| **Fast2SMS** | Quick setup      | ₹0.15-0.30/SMS | ❌ No        |
| **AWS SNS**  | Enterprise       | $0.00645/SMS   | ❌ No        |

All are **cheaper** and **easier** than Twilio for India! 🇮🇳
