# ✅ Text Trigger for Appointment Booking

## Feature Implemented

When users type phrases like "book appointment" in the chat, the system now automatically starts the appointment booking flow - the same as clicking the "Book Appointment" button in Quick Actions.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Trigger Phrases (Case-insensitive)

Any of these phrases will start the appointment flow:

- "book appointment"
- "book an appointment"
- "make appointment"
- "make an appointment"
- "schedule appointment"
- "schedule an appointment"
- "i want to book appointment"
- "i need appointment"
- "need an appointment"

### User Experience

**User types:** "book appointment"

**System responds with:**

```
User: book appointment

Bot: 📅 Great! Let's book your appointment.

👤 First, what's your name?
```

Then the same step-by-step flow begins:

1. Name
2. Phone number
3. Date
4. Time
5. Reason

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### File Modified: `frontend/src/App.jsx`

**Location:** `handleSendMessage()` function (lines 974-1024)

**What Changed:**

Added detection logic BEFORE processing normal messages:

```javascript
// Check if user is trying to book appointment (and not already in flow)
const appointmentTriggers = [
  "book appointment",
  "book an appointment",
  "make appointment",
  "make an appointment",
  "schedule appointment",
  "schedule an appointment",
  "i want to book appointment",
  "i need appointment",
  "need an appointment",
];

const isBookingRequest = appointmentTriggers.some((trigger) =>
  currentInput.toLowerCase().includes(trigger)
);

if (isBookingRequest && !appointmentFlow.active) {
  // Start appointment flow
  setMessages((prev) => [
    ...prev,
    {
      type: "user",
      content: currentInput,
      timestamp: formatTime(new Date()),
    },
    {
      type: "bot",
      content:
        "📅 Great! Let's book your appointment.\n\n👤 First, what's your name?",
      timestamp: formatTime(new Date()),
    },
  ]);
  setAppointmentFlow({
    active: true,
    step: 0,
    data: { name: "", phone: "", date: "", time: "", reason: "" },
  });
  setMessageCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  setInputMessage("");
  setIsTyping(false);
  return;
}
```
