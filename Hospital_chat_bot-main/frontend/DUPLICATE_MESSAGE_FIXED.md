# 🔧 Fixed Duplicate Appointment Messages

## ❌ The Problem

When booking an appointment, users saw **TWO** messages:

```
✅ Appointment booked successfully!
📋 Summary:
👤 Name: ez
📞 Phone: 67890324567
📅 Date: tmr
🕐 Time: 10
📝 Reason: check up

✅ Appointment request has been successfully sent to the admin, soon we will reach out to you.
👤 Name: Ez
📞 Phone: 📞 67890324567
📅 Date: Not specified
🕐 Time: Not specified
📝 Reason: ez (67890324567) on tmr at 10. reason: check
```

**Why?**

- Frontend was creating its own summary
- Backend was also creating a summary
- Frontend was appending both together!

---

## ✅ The Solution

Changed the frontend to use **ONLY** the backend response.

### File: `frontend/src/App.jsx` (Line 1056)

**Before:**

```jsx
content: `✅ Appointment booked successfully!\n\n📋 Summary:\n👤 Name: ${newFlow.data.name}\n📞 Phone: ${newFlow.data.phone}\n📅 Date: ${newFlow.data.date}\n🕐 Time: ${newFlow.data.time}\n📝 Reason: ${newFlow.data.reason}\n\n${response.response || 'Your appointment has been submitted...'}`,
```

**After:**

```jsx
content: response.response || 'Your appointment has been submitted to our team. You will be contacted shortly for confirmation.',
```

## 🎯 Now Users See Only ONE Clean Message

```
✅ Appointment request has been successfully sent to the admin, soon we will reach out to you.

👤 Name: Ez
