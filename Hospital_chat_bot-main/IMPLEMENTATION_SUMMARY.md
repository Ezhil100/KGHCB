## 🎨 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### **Scenario: Fever + Appointment**

```
User: "I have fever and need appointment"
           ↓
Backend detects:
  ✓ has_info_query = True (keyword: "fever")
  ✓ wants_appointment = True (keyword: "appointment")
           ↓
Backend processes:
  1. RAG answers fever question
  2. Sets show_appointment_button = True
  3. Sets suggested_reason = "Fever treatment"
           ↓
Frontend receives:
  {
    response: "Doctor info...",
    show_appointment_button: true,
    suggested_reason: "Fever treatment"
  }
           ↓
Frontend renders:
  - Doctor information
  - [📅 Book Appointment] button
           ↓
User clicks button:
  - appointmentFlow.active = true
  - appointmentFlow.data.reason = "Fever treatment"
