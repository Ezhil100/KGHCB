# Appointment Date/Time Extraction Fix

## Issue

When booking appointments through the calendar picker, the confirmation message was showing:

```
👤 Name: Lknl
📞 Phone: 📞 9999999999
📅 Date: Not specified
🕐 Time: Not specified
📝 Reason: internal
```

Even though the backend received the full message:

```
Book appointment for lknl (9999999999) on Friday, October 24, 2025 at 10. Reason: internal
```

## Root Cause

The `extract_appointment_details()` function in `admin_api.py` had regex patterns that didn't properly match:

1. **Calendar-formatted dates**: "Friday, October 24, 2025" (full weekday and month names)
2. **Simple time format**: "at 10." (hour without AM/PM, with period)

## Solution

### Updated Date Patterns

Added pattern to match calendar picker's date format at the **highest priority**:

```python
r'\b(?:Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday),\s+(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)\s+\d{1,2},\s+\d{4}\b'
```

This matches: "Friday, October 24, 2025"

### Updated Time Patterns

Added patterns to handle time with or without AM/PM:

```python
r'\bat\s+(\d{1,2})\.?\s*(?:Reason|$)'  # "at 10." with optional period
r'\bat\s+(\d{1,2})\b'                  # "at 10" without period
```

This extracts: "10" from "at 10."

### Complete Pattern Order (Priority)

**Date patterns** (checked in this order):

1. Full calendar format: "Friday, October 24, 2025"
2. Numeric slashes: "10/24/2025" or "24-10-2025"
3. ISO format: "2025-10-24"
4. Relative: "today", "tomorrow", "next week"

**Time patterns** (checked in this order):

1. With minutes and AM/PM: "10:00 AM"
2. Hour only with AM/PM: "10 AM"
3. "at" with hour and period: "at 10."
4. "at" with hour: "at 10"
5. Time of day: "morning", "afternoon", "evening"

## Changes Made

### File: `Backend/admin_api.py`

#### Before:

```python
date_patterns = [
    r'\b\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{2,4}\b',
    r'\b\d{4}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}\b',
    r'\b(today|tomorrow|tmr|next week|next month)\b'
]

time_patterns = [
    r'\b\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s*(?:am|pm|AM|PM)\b',
    r'\b\d{1,2}\s*(?:am|pm|AM|PM)\b',
    r'\b(morning|afternoon|evening)\b'
]
```

#### After:

```python
date_patterns = [
    r'\b(?:Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Sunday),\s+(?:January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)\s+\d{1,2},\s+\d{4}\b',  # Calendar format
    r'\b\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{2,4}\b',  # Numeric
    r'\b\d{4}[/-]\d{1,2}[/-]\d{1,2}\b',  # ISO
    r'\b(today|tomorrow|tmr|next week|next month)\b'  # Relative
]

time_patterns = [
    r'\b\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s*(?:am|pm|AM|PM)\b',  # "10:00 AM"
    r'\b\d{1,2}\s*(?:am|pm|AM|PM)\b',  # "10 AM"
    r'\bat\s+(\d{1,2})\.?\s*(?:Reason|$)',  # "at 10."
    r'\bat\s+(\d{1,2})\b',  # "at 10"
    r'\b(morning|afternoon|evening)\b'  # Time of day
]
```

## Testing

### Test Message Format

**Extracted**:

- Date: "Friday, October 24, 2025" ✅
- Time: "10" ✅
- Reason: "internal" ✅

### Example 2: Numeric Date + AM/PM Time

**Input**: `Book appointment for John (1234567890) on 10/25/2025 at 2:30 PM. Reason: checkup`

**Extracted**:

- Date: "10/25/2025" ✅
- Time: "2:30 PM" ✅
- Reason: "checkup" ✅

### Example 3: Relative Date + Time of Day

**Input**: `Book appointment for Jane (9876543210) on tomorrow at morning. Reason: consultation`

**Extracted**:

- Date: "tomorrow" ✅

## Notes

- **Auto-reload**: Backend runs with `uvicorn --reload`, changes apply automatically
- **Pattern Priority**: More specific patterns (calendar format) checked first
- **Fallback Support**: Still supports typed dates like "tomorrow", "next Monday"
- **Time Flexibility**: Handles "10", "10 AM", "10:00 AM", "morning", etc.
- **No Frontend Changes**: Fix is entirely backend regex improvements
