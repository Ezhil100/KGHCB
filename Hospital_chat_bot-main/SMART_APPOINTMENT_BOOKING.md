# 🎯 Smart Appointment Booking - Information First Approach

## ✨ Feature Overview

When users ask compound questions like **"I have fever, who should I consult and I need to book an appointment"**, the system now:

1. ✅ **Shows relevant doctor information FIRST**
2. ✅ **Displays a "Book Appointment" button** below the information
3. ✅ **Triggers booking flow** only when user clicks the button
4. ✅ **Pre-fills reason** based on the symptom mentioned

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Backend Intelligence (main.py)**

**1. Dual Intent Detection:**

```python
has_info_query = detect_information_query(message)  # Fever, symptoms, doctor questions
wants_appointment = detect_appointment_intent(message)  # Book appointment keywords

if has_info_query and wants_appointment:
    # COMPOUND QUERY - Show info with button
    show_appointment_button = True
```

**2. Smart Reason Extraction:**

```python
reason_keywords = {
    'fever': 'Fever treatment',
    'headache': 'Headache consultation',
    'pain': 'Pain management',
    'diabetes': 'Diabetes consultation',
    # ... more mappings
}
# Automatically suggests reason for faster booking
```

**3. Enhanced Response:**

```python
ChatResponse(
    response=formatted_answer,
    show_appointment_button=True,  # NEW!
    suggested_reason="Fever treatment"  # NEW!
)
```

### **Frontend Display (App.jsx)**

**1. Button Rendering:**

```jsx
{
  message.showAppointmentButton && message.type === "bot" && (
    <button
      style={styles.inlineAppointmentBtn}
      onClick={() => {
        // Start appointment flow with pre-filled reason
        setAppointmentFlow({
          active: true,
          step: 0,
          data: {
            name: "",
            phone: "",
            date: "",
            time: "",
            reason: suggestedReason,
          },
        });
      }}
    >
      📅 Book Appointment
    </button>
  );
}
```

**2. Button Styling:**

- Orange gradient matching app theme
- Touch-friendly size (44px+ height)
- Responsive width (max 250px)
- Smooth hover effect
- Icon + text label
