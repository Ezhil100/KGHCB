# Emoji Removal from Chat Messages

## Summary

Removed all emojis from chat messages while keeping emojis in actionable buttons (Quick Actions, Emergency buttons, etc.).

## Changes Made

### Frontend (App.jsx)

#### Bot Messages - Appointment Flow

**Before → After:**

1. **Initial appointment message:**

   - Before: `'📅 Great! Let\'s book your appointment.\n\n👤 First, what\'s your name?'`
   - After: `'Great! Let\'s book your appointment.\n\nFirst, what\'s your name?'`

2. **Phone number request:**

   - Before: `'📱 Great! What\'s your phone number?'`
   - After: `'Great! What\'s your phone number?'`

3. **Phone validation error:**

   - Before: `'❌ Please enter a valid phone number...'`
   - After: `'Please enter a valid phone number...'`

4. **Date request:**

   - Before: `'📅 When would you like to schedule your appointment?...'`
   - After: `'When would you like to schedule your appointment?...'`

5. **Time request (text input):**

   - Before: `'🕐 What time works best for you?...'`
   - After: `'What time works best for you?...'`

6. **Time request (calendar picker):**

   - Before: `'🕒 What time would you prefer?...'`
   - After: `'What time would you prefer?...'`

7. **Reason request:**

   - Before: `'📝 What is the reason for your visit?...'`
   - After: `'What is the reason for your visit?...'`

8. **Booking error:**

   - Before: `'❌ Sorry, there was an error booking...'`
   - After: `'Sorry, there was an error booking...'`

9. **Calendar date picker label:**

   - Before: `'📅 Select your preferred appointment date:'`
   - After: `'Select your preferred appointment date:'`

10. **Quick Action "Book Appointment":**
    - Before: `'📅 Great! Let\'s book your appointment.\n\n👤 First, what\'s your name?'`
    - After: `'Great! Let\'s book your appointment.\n\nFirst, what\'s your name?'`

### Backend (main.py)

#### Appointment Confirmation Message

**Before:**

```python
f"✅ Appointment request has been successfully sent to the admin...\n\n"
f"👤 Name: {name}\n"
f"📞 Phone: {phone_line}\n"
f"📅 Date: {preferred_date}\n"
f"🕐 Time: {preferred_time}\n"
f"📝 Reason: {reason}"
```

**After:**

```python
f"Appointment request has been successfully sent to the admin...\n\n"
f"Name: {name}\n"
f"Phone: {phone_line}\n"
f"Date: {preferred_date}\n"
f"Time: {preferred_time}\n"
f"Reason: {reason}"
```

## What Was Kept

### Emojis in Actionable Buttons (Kept as Requested)

1. **Quick Actions Emergency Button:**

   - `'Emergency: 📞 0422-2324105'` ✅ (Kept)

2. **Appointment Flow Banner Icon:**

   - `<span style={styles.flowIcon}>📅</span>` ✅ (Kept)

3. **Step Progress Checkmarks:**

   - `{idx < appointmentFlow.step ? '✓' : idx + 1}` ✅ (Kept)

4. **Icon Components:**
   - All `<Icons.Check />`, `<Icons.Error />`, `<Icons.Reload />` etc. ✅ (Kept)
   - These are SVG components, not emoji text

## Result

### Chat Messages - Now Clean Text

```
Bot: Great! Let's book your appointment.

First, what's your name?

User: John

Bot: Great! What's your phone number?
