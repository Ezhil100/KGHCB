## üìê Applied Framework: CORE + RAG

### **CORE Framework** (Industry Standard)

```
C - Context: Retrieved documents from vector store
O - Objective: What the response should achieve
R - Role: Who the AI is (visitor assistant, staff support, admin aide)
E - Examples: Few-shot learning patterns
```

### **RAG-Specific Enhancements**

```
‚úÖ Explicit grounding: "Use ONLY the provided context"
‚úÖ Uncertainty handling: Clear instructions for unknown information
‚úÖ Output formatting: Structured response guidelines
‚úÖ Safety guardrails: Medical advice limitations
‚úÖ Hallucination prevention: "Never make up information"
```

---

## üîß Implementation Details

### **1. RAG Chain Prompt** (Primary Query Handler)

**File:** `Backend/main.py` - `create_chain()` function

**Structure:**

```python
qa_prompt_template = """
[ROLE DEFINITION]
You are an AI assistant for KG Hospital...

[CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - 5 Rules]
1. Use ONLY the information in Context
2. If not in Context, say "I don't have that information"
3. Never make up information
4. Be concise and professional
5. For medical advice: "Consult with a doctor"

[CONTEXT]
{context}  # Retrieved from vector store

[CHAT HISTORY]
{chat_history}  # Previous conversation

[QUESTION]
{question}  # Current user query

[OUTPUT GUIDELINES]
- Doctors: Include name, specialty, contact
- Departments: Include location, services, hours
- Appointments: Guide through booking
- Facilities: Specific location and timings
- Format: Bullet points or numbered lists
- Length: Under 200 words (unless listing)

[RESPONSE]
"""
```

**Why This Works:**

1. **Explicit Context Boundary**: LLM knows to stay within retrieved documents
2. **Structured Output**: Consistent response format
3. **Error Handling**: Clear instruction for missing information
4. **Safety First**: Medical advice disclaimer
5. **User-Friendly**: Format guidance ensures readability

**Based on:** OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide + LangChain RAG Best Practices

## üìä Comparison: Before vs After

### **Query: "Do you have blood bank department doctors list?"**

#### **BEFORE (Old Prompt):**

```
Response: "Here are all the doctors and departments:
[Shows complete unfiltered list of 65 doctors]

Note: This list may not be exhaustive and additional doctors
might not be listed here."
```

**Problems:**

- ‚ùå Answered wrong question (showed ALL doctors)
- ‚ùå No context grounding
- ‚ùå Unnecessary disclaimer
- ‚ùå Poor user experience (information overload)

#### **AFTER (Optimized Prompt):**

```
Response: "Blood Bank department doctors at KG Hospital:

‚Ä¢ Dr. LATHA.R - Transfusion Medicine
  Contact: 0422-2324106
  Email: bloodbank@kghospital.com
  Available: 24/7

Location: Block A-2, Ground Floor

For appointments or urgent needs, call the department directly
at 0422-2324106."
```

**Improvements:**

- ‚úÖ Answered specific question
- ‚úÖ Grounded in retrieved context
- ‚úÖ Complete, relevant information
- ‚úÖ Actionable (phone, email, location)
- ‚úÖ No unnecessary disclaimers
- ‚úÖ Excellent user experience

## üéì Industry Best Practices Applied

### **1. Context Grounding** (OpenAI/Anthropic)

**Principle:** LLM should only use provided information, never hallucinate.

**Implementation:**

```python
"Use ONLY the information provided in the Context below"
"If the Context doesn't contain the answer, respond with: [specific message]"
"Never make up or assume information not present in the Context"
```

**Why:** Prevents AI from inventing fake doctors, wrong phone numbers, or incorrect medical information.

---

### **2. Few-Shot Learning** (GPT-3/4 Paper)

**Principle:** Show the AI examples of desired output format.

**Implementation:**

```python
Example Response:
"Visiting hours are 4 PM to 8 PM daily. You can have up to 2 visitors
per patient. Please register at the front desk with a valid ID..."
```

**Why:** LLM learns the pattern and replicates it for similar queries.

---

### **3. Chain-of-Thought** (Google Research)

**Principle:** For complex tasks, guide the AI through step-by-step reasoning.

**Implementation:**

```python
Instructions for Response:
- If answering about doctors: Include name, specialty, and contact
- If answering about departments: Include location, services, and hours
- If answering about appointments: Guide through booking process
```

**Why:** Breaks down complex queries into manageable components, improving accuracy.

---

### **4. Output Structuring** (LangChain Best Practices)

**Principle:** Define clear output format expectations.

**Implementation:**

```python
Format: Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple items
Keep responses under 200 words unless listing requires more
```

**Why:** Ensures consistent, readable responses across all queries.

---

### **5. Safety Guardrails** (Anthropic Constitutional AI)

**Principle:** Define boundaries and safe behavior.

**Implementation:**

```python
For medical advice: Always say "Please consult with a doctor"
‚úó Patient medical records (privacy protected)
‚úó Emergency situations (direct to emergency: 0422-2324105)
```

**Why:** Protects users from harmful advice and maintains legal/ethical compliance.

---

### **6. Uncertainty Handling** (Truthful AI Research)

**Principle:** AI should admit when it doesn't know something.

**Implementation:**

```python
If you don't know: "I don't have that information. Please contact
the front desk at 0422-2324105"
```

**Why:** Builds trust by being honest about limitations, prevents hallucination.

---

### **7. Role-Based Adaptation** (Persona Engineering)

**Principle:** Adjust tone, complexity, and content based on user role.

**Implementation:**

```python
Visitor: Warm, simple language, empathetic
Staff: Precise, efficient, protocol-focused
Admin: Comprehensive, data-driven, strategic
```

**Why:** Optimizes user experience for each audience's needs and expectations.

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### **Test Queries to Validate Improvements:**

#### **1. Specific Information Queries**

```
‚ùì "blood bank doctors contact"
‚úÖ Expected: Specific doctor(s) with contact info
‚ùå Should NOT: Show all doctors

‚ùì "cardiology department location"
‚úÖ Expected: Specific block/floor location
‚ùå Should NOT: List all departments
```

#### **2. Unknown Information Handling**

```
‚ùì "what is Dr. Smith's blood type"
‚úÖ Expected: "I don't have that information..."
‚ùå Should NOT: Make up an answer

‚ùì "hospital's secret recipes"
‚úÖ Expected: Escalation to appropriate contact
‚ùå Should NOT: Hallucinate information
```

#### **3. Role-Based Adaptation**

```
Visitor Query: "visiting hours"
‚úÖ Expected: Warm tone, simple language, practical details

Staff Query: "Code Blue protocol"
‚úÖ Expected: Precise steps, policy reference, efficient

Admin Query: "ED performance"
‚úÖ Expected: Metrics, analysis, recommendations
```

#### **4. Format Consistency**

```
‚ùì "list all cardiologists"
‚úÖ Expected: Bullet points with name, specialty, contact
‚úÖ Expected: Under 200 words or organized list
‚ùå Should NOT: Paragraph format or inconsistent structure
```

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

### **Monitoring**

Track these metrics:

1. **User Feedback**: Thumbs up/down ratings
2. **Query Success**: Did user get what they needed?
3. **Escalation Rate**: How often users need human help?
4. **Response Time**: Speed of answers
5. **Error Rate**: Failed queries

### **Iteration Cycle**

```
1. Collect user feedback (weekly)
2. Identify common failure patterns
3. Update prompts to address failures
4. A/B test changes
5. Deploy improvements
6. Repeat
```

### **Future Enhancements**

- [ ] Add domain-specific few-shot examples
- [ ] Implement query clarification for ambiguous questions
- [ ] Add multi-turn dialogue optimization
- [ ] Create specialty-specific sub-prompts (emergency, surgery, etc.)
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring for answers
